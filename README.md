# ASRB-RISC-V-Boom-Reconfig

Optimized the RISC-V Small BOOM config for applications such as ML, FFT, Decryption, Graph Traversal, etc. through Chisel. Includes changes to the branch predictor, cache replacement policy and pipeline changes. Used metrics such as CPI and branch misprediction rate on custom benchmarks to justify and evaluate the reconfiguration. Included all the files with the relevant changes.
